## How to access site
To access the site you must either be connected to Aalborg university's internet or connected to the Aalborg university's VPN service https://www.en.its.aau.dk/instructions/vpn. 
When this is done first go to the site https://10.92.1.237:8080 to allow the API to work, notice that your browser will give a warning. This is because the SSL certificate is self-signed. Ignore the warning and enter the site. Now the normal site can be visited on https://10.92.1.237/, here you will encounter a login page, below can be seen some different logins with different roles.
